# Koch-Snowflake\

In your README.md file, write down how you might code the Koch Snowflake. Be sure to include: 
A description of what happens at every recursive step. In the big picture, we are splitting one line segment into four, but you'll need a bit more detail than that. 
A description of the base case (how the recursion stops)
How you might use the translate and rotate functions to your benefit. 

Steps for being able to code the koch snowflake:
  1. We would have to create an equilateral triangle.
